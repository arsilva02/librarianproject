I think the time spent at sinegard is the best of kuangs writing. when we get into the war parts, it just feels like we're running in circles and circles just about war and destruction, which I suppose is the point but it didn't make reading about it for 2.5 books even close to worth it. when we finally escape that cycle in the end, it feels very anticlimactic when all is said and done. I also have to say I have a lot of gripes about how kuang tackles the idea of rape and indigenous savegry. don't love how much she talks about how brown skinned and angry and uncontrollable rin is.<br><br>but I think generally, especially with how babel and yellowface are written, this trilogy was a lot better about nuance and subtly. I guess she got tired of people taking the wrong message about her book if it isnt spelled out for them. seriously, the (select few) of her characters make reading worth it.
