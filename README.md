# Librarian Project

## A note about data
The data I am using in this project is either public information from the publisher (blurb, imprint, pub date, etc.) or my own personal data (my own reviews). I use [The StoryGraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/) to track my reading data, and used the "Export your library" feature to generate the CSV. It is currently about a year's worth of data and ~120 books read, so it isn't a huge dataset. I also have about 600 books marked as to-read. You could use a similar technique using [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/), but it lacks a lot of features that can make the dataset sparse in feature richness (most notably, you can only rate books as whole stars 1-5, while in The StoryGraph you can rate using .25 star incriments). As this is a personalized recommendation system, I do not think crowd-sourcing would be appropriate for this particular project. I am making my data public and free to use. I read a wide variety of genres, but I still have a bias towards genres such as literary, contemporary, and historical, and I have not read much in the way of essays, young adult, and philosphy. Again, I would recommend using your own data if you are a reader to make your own personalized system using similar techniques. Also, keep in mind that in some of my reviews there are spoilers for certain books (marked with a spoiler tag), though that data will not end up in the final model when we clean the dataframe.
